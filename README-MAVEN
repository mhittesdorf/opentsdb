In order to build this project using maven you will need to install all of the dependencies listed in the pom.xml into your local maven repository. I could not find many of the specific versions of the third party jars that were in the third party directory of the original StumbleUpon build of opentsdb.  I considered choosing maven artifacts and versions available in the Maven central repository that seemed 'close' but ultimately decided against this so as not to inadvertently introduce bugs. As such, I checked in all of the original third party jars into my own local maven repository using the group id, artifact id and version referenced in the current pom.xml.  Once you have done this you can build the project by typing 'mvn install' and everything should just work. The necessary third party jars can be obtained from StumbleUpon's master git repository at https://github.com/stumbleupon/opentsdb/tree/master/third_party.

I also created an assembly file that packages all jars, xml files, static resources, etc into a tar.gz archive. This archive can be generated with the command 'mvn assembly:assembly'. The archive can then be copied to your deployment directory and expanded.  The directory structure created is suitable then for running the Time Series Daemon (TSD) with the command './tsdb tsd --port=4242 --staticroot=/tmp/opentsdb-1.1.1-SNAPSHOT/static --cachedir=/tmp/tsd', for example.

Enjoy! Mick
